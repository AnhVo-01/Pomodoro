            <p>Hello everyone,</p><br>
            <p>Welcome you to my website.</p><br>
            <p>
                I'm AnhVo. As a student of FPT University, and a lover of programming. <br>
                Currently, there are many websites providing timers Pomodoro Technique, from free to paid. <br>
                But I want to have a timer of my own, designed by myself; as well as improve my programming skills. And, <span style="color: tomato;">TomatoTM</span> was created.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I'm not a web designer (not yet), and I know that my website has quite a lot of bugs. <br>
                If you are a Web Designer or a general user who accidentally visited this website, give me some suggestions or feedback so I can improve.
            </p><br>
            <!-- <p>And you're already here, I hope you enjoy it and use it.</p><br>
            <p>Thanks,</p> -->
